1. Why MapReduce program is needed in Pig Programming?

      - In Pig programming mapreduce is used gor improving optimization opportunities,extensibility and ease of programming.
      - MapReduce is needed for using cross products,joins,distributed cahe.
      - Hadoop developers require MapRedure for driver program control.
      - It is required for testing large data sets.

2.What are advantages of Pig over MapReduce?

      - It is non-declarative
      - Less development time.
      - Easy learning curve than mapreduce.
      - Effective for large datasets.
      - It is procedural so we can control every step.

3.What is Pig engine and what is its importance?

      - Pig engine converts pig latin scripts to MapRdeuce jobs.
      - It acts like an interpreter between Pig Latin Script and Map reduce jobs
      - It performs parallely.
      - It is one of the compenent of Pig.

4.What are the modes of Pig execution?

    There are two nodes in Pig execution.They are,
                    * Local Mode
                    * MapReduce Mode
      - In Local mode,we use single machine for running pig.All files are stored and runned in local file system.
      - In MapReduce mode,we use hadoop cluster for running pig.Here we perform some operations on files which are located in HDFS.

5.What is Grunt shell in pig?

    - It is used for writting Pig Latin Scripts.
    - They are used for running pig in the shell.
    - DFS commands and pig commands are supported by grunt shell.
    - It is used as  an interactive shell and batch mode.

6.What are the features of  Pig Latin Language?

    - It is extensible and case sensitive.
    - It allows user to work in many ways.
    - It allows user to retrieve the results.
    - It includes operators that allowaa user to debug the pig latin statements.

7.Is Pig Latin commands case sensitive?

    - The name and fields of pig latin functions are case sensitive. 
    - The parameters and all other pig latin keywords of the names are case sensitive.

8.What is data flow language?

    - Data flow language is a contro flow language.A stream of data passes from instruction to instruction to be processed.
    - It implements dataflow principles and architecture.
    - It models a program as a directed graph of the data.
